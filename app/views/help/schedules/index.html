<h2>Schedules</h2>

<p>Schedules are used to have TestCaseDB trigger automation runs for you. Select the time and days you would like the test plans to run and TestCaseDB will take care of the rest.</p>

<p>Note that the test plan will need to include test cases that are marked as automated and include the require test scripts.</p>
