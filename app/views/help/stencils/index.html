<h2>Stencils</h2>
<p>Stencils are test plan collections</p>

<p>A stencil contains multiple test plans (including duplicates) and related devices. Stencils make it really easy to quickly assign a set of test plans and resources that must be tested. This is especially useful for regression tracking.</p>

<h3>New Version</h3>
<p>The new version button will make a clone of the current test plan. The current plan will be marked as deprecated and the new version will contain the previous versions details.</p>
  
<p>Versions are useful when making major changes and you have the need to retain the status of your old test plan.</p>
