<h2>Welcome to TestCaseDB</h2>

<p>The homepage is your intro into what is happening in TestCaseDB. The two main components are displayed; Recent Activity and current tasks.</p>

<h3>Recent Activity</h3>

<p>The recent activity feed shows you recent changes within the system to keep you up-to-date.</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<p>The tasks listing on the homepage shows tasks that are assigned to you with their due date. If the task is highlighted red, it is overdue.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>If you're new to TestCaseDB, the dashboard won't have anything too interesting. Have your admin configure Products and Categories on the Admin page to get started. Once that done you can start creating test cases and test plans.</p>
