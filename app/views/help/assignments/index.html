<p>Assignments enable you to associate a test plan or stencil with a user and release for testing.</p>

<p>When assignments are created, the associated result entries in the DB are also created for tracking.</p>

<p>If you need to frequently combin multiple test plans per release for testing, you should consider using stencils.</p>
